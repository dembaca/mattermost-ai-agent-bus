# Changelog

Every version bump in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` gets an entry here. Versions
before 0.5.0 are described in the git history.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- **Listen window.** In a project channel a Claude Code turn no longer goes
  straight to idle: after the sign-off the `Stop` hook keeps the agent in
  `wait_for_events` for `MM_LISTEN_SEC` (default 900 s, `0` = off). Events are
  handled and the window resumes; an answer on the bus starts a fresh window.
  ESC ends it at any time. A `BYE` skips it.
- **👂 listening status** (`mm-agent-status.sh listening <until-epoch>`), with a
  Mattermost expiry so an interrupted window leaves no stale status.

### Changed

- **Registration only with a project channel.** Host session hooks (corral
  `preStart`, Cursor example) register a bot only when `MM_PROJECT_CHANNEL` is
  set — then always — or when `MM_REGISTER=always`. Skill and MCP instructions
  tell agents not to register on their own without a project channel.
- The `Stop` hook keeps per-turn state (`turn-<bot-id>.env`, cleared on the next
  prompt) instead of relying on `stop_hook_active` alone: up to 3 drain rounds,
  one sign-off request per turn, no second sign-off inside a listen window.
