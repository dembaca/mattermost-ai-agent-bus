# Changelog

Every version bump in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` gets an entry here. Versions
before 0.5.0 are described in the git history.

## 0.7.0

### Added

- **Banner in the terminal.** Every block of the `Stop` hook now shows the
  developer a one-line `systemMessage` saying why the turn goes on:
  📨 collecting unread messages, ✋ signing off, or
  👂 `Listening on Mattermost until HH:MM (N min left) · ESC to stop` for each
  slice of the listen window.

### Changed

- The `Stop` hook blocks with JSON on stdout and exit 0 (Claude Code's
  structured hook output) instead of exit 2 with JSON on stderr.

## 0.6.1

### Fixed

- **Listen window no longer loops.** The `Stop` hook asked for one
  `wait_for_events` call covering the whole window (up to 900 s), but Claude
  Code moves an MCP call past about 120 s to the background and ends the turn.
  The hook never saw the `[]` it waited for, fired again with a shorter rest,
  and each round left another listener running. The window is now listened to
  in slices of at most `MM_LISTEN_CALL_SEC` (default 100 s).
- **A newer `wait_for_events` supersedes a pending one**: the older call returns
  `[]`, so a backgrounded listener cannot swallow events meant for the
  foreground.

## 0.6.0

### Changed

- **`MM_BOT_NAME` is now `MM_REG_BOT_NAME`**, everywhere: environment, session
  files, CLI, MCP server, hooks. It is the registrar's short name for the bot,
  not its Mattermost identity (`MM_BOT_USERNAME`). No fallback to the old name:
  session files written before 0.6.0 are not read any more — run
  `bin/mm-agent-sweep.sh --apply` on the host before updating, or rename the key
  in leftover files under `~/.local/state/mm-agent-bus/`.
- Docs no longer call the withheld name a security measure: the registrar
  deletes a bot only with the secret or the bot's own token. Withholding it
  keeps the CLI in the sandbox from stopping a session the host owns.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- **Listen window.** In a project channel a Claude Code turn no longer goes
  straight to idle: after the sign-off the `Stop` hook keeps the agent in
  `wait_for_events` for `MM_LISTEN_SEC` (default 900 s, `0` = off). Events are
  handled and the window resumes; an answer on the bus starts a fresh window.
  ESC ends it at any time. A `BYE` skips it.
- **👂 listening status** (`mm-agent-status.sh listening <until-epoch>`), with a
  Mattermost expiry so an interrupted window leaves no stale status.

### Changed

- **Registration only with a project channel.** Host session hooks (corral
  `preStart`, Cursor example) register a bot only when `MM_PROJECT_CHANNEL` is
  set — then always — or when `MM_REGISTER=always`. Skill and MCP instructions
  tell agents not to register on their own without a project channel.
- The `Stop` hook keeps per-turn state (`turn-<bot-id>.env`, cleared on the next
  prompt) instead of relying on `stop_hook_active` alone: up to 3 drain rounds,
  one sign-off request per turn, no second sign-off inside a listen window.
